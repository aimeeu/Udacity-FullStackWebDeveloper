Project 2 in Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
========================================================

Project 2: Students were provided with a design mockup in PDF format as a starting point and asked to replicate/enhance the design using HTML and CSS.

This project was created using `Bootstrap 4.1 <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/>`_.

The main page is ``index.html``; supporting files are in the assets directory.

Responsive web design was tested using Google Chrome's Web Developer Tools.
